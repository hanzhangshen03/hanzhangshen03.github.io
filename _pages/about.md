Welcome to my webpage! I am an undergraduate student at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk), majoring in Computer Science. Previously, I spent 4 good years studying at Dunman High School, Singapore.

I am currently doing research on Efficient AI and Computer Vision, supervised by [Prof. Huan Wang](https://huanwang.tech/) at ENCODE Lab, Westlake University, and [Prof. Yulun Zhang](https://yulunzhang.com/) at AI Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
